# Nvim basics

I like lazyvim, but I don't agree with every choice made there, and I have a hard time understanding some of the logic in that repo.
I also found [Nvpunk](https://gitlab.com/gabmus/nvpunk/-/tree/master/lua/nvpunk?ref_type=heads), which has a fun split between "distro" and user-config, but I don't agree with keybinds and plugin choices there.

So I'll steal some of the setup structure from Nvpunk, build a config from scratch, and have a place to experiment with plugins before they become part of the "basics".

## Plugins I want

- Treesitter
- blink.cmp for completion
- obsidian.nvim
- vim-test
- gitsigns.nvim
- folds like in lazyvim
- a statusline
- a picker (fzf-lua? snacks? mini.pick?)
